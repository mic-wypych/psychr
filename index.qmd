# Introduction to R

## What this website is about

This is a website accompanying the Introduction to R course at the Faculty of Psychology at University of Warsaw. The course covers basics of working in R, from the basic operations to fundamental statistics. No knowledge of R is assumed but basic knowledge of statistics is required to follow the course (especially for the latter topics).

Please note that this website **is not a substitution for the course**. It supplements and extends it but cannot replace it.
