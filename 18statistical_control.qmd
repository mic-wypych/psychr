So far we have been working with only 1 independent variable at a time.

## What is statistical control?

-   What does it mean to control for a variable?

-   How do we do it in R?

## To control or not to control?

-   What are confounders

-   Basic types of confounds: fork, mediator, collider, descendant. A really good paper on this topic is [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459221095823).

-   Why throwing things into the model does not work: McElreath Regression, fire dangerous things

-   When should you control?

-   Interpreting coefficients from covariates - should you?\
    For example you might be tempted to interpret the effect of gender which was included in a model as a covariate. But ask yourself - is it the total or direct effect?

-   What does introducing a covariate change about the model?
