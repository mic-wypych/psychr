# Data wrangling

Now that we have our dataset loaded we can finally get to work with it!

## Tidyverse

We'll be working within Tidyverse throughout this course.

-Explain what tidyverse is

-How each package functions within tidyverse

For now we'll focus on dplyr.

## The pipe

-What is the pipe, why it's useful

-Native pipe alternative

## The basic dplyr function

-Filter

-Select

-Mutate

-Summarise

-Group by

-Arrange

## Combining functions together

-Chaining functions together with pipes

This already gives us the ability to anwser a number of questions that might be very interesting for analysis.

## Base R alternatives

-make this section optional: if you want to see how to achieve similar things but without using tiduverse
