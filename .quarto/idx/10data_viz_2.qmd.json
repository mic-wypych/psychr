Now we'll move on to additional layers in ggplot2\n\n## Faceting\n\nThere are situations in which there is too much information to put it in a single plot.\n\n## Statistics\n\n-   how to represent statistics on a plot\n\n-   Pre-calculating values\n\n-   stat_summary\n\n## Coordinates\n\nThis layer controls how the coordinates of the plot should be handled. Most likely you are used to plots with the cartesian space: an x and y axis that are perpendicular. However you can change that e.g. by fising the ratio of x to y axis, zooming in on a particualr part of the plot or even bending the axis altogether.\n\n## Theme\n\nThe final layer, called theme, controlls all the non-data part of the plot: setting fonts, typeface, text size, controlling the background color, plot legend and the grid.\n\nThere is a number of pre-specified themes that you can use but you can also control everything manually. You can check the documentation of `theme()` to see just how many elements you can control.\n\n-   some example themes\n\n-   controlling theme yourself\n\n### Fonts in R\n\nA note on working with fonts: if you want to work with more fonts than the built-in ones you will have to load them into R. This can sometimes prove quite problematic.\n\n-   showtext package\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"10data_viz_2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title":"Data visualization part 2"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
