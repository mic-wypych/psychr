Lots of things can also happen that can make analysis or drawing conclusions difficult (like how reliable are your scales, are the items recoded correctly etc.)\n\n-   discuss some common problems e.g. in qualtrics?\n\n\n-   if you have it, start with any documentation on the dataset (like codebooks etc.)\n\n-   Getting basic info on the data: glimpse etc.\n\n-   Describe from psych package\n\n-   Getting information on categorical variables\n\n## Exploring via plots\n\nWhy plotting data is always important\n\nA cautionary tale the boring way: Anscombe quartet\n\nThe fun way: Gorilla in the data\n\nThe key takeaway is that a lot of things that are wrong or at least problematic can be immediately spotted when you plot the data. e.g. in when comparing two conditions of an experiment you might spot that the whole effect is driven but just a few outliers.\n\n## reliabilities\n\n-getting reliability analysis with alpha()\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"12eda.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title":"Exploratory Data Analysis"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
